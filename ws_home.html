						<h1>About Me</h1>
						<table>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<th>Education</th>
									<td>I graduated from Texas A&M University with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Astrophysics.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Research</th>
									<td>I started researching in my junior year of highs chool where I studied the synthesis of YBCO high temperature superconductors at UTD under Dr.Bing Lv. culminating in a presentation of my work to undergrad students and faculty.
										At TAMU I studied the characterisation and modeling of hybrid rocket engines and their combustion mechanism. I gave a presentation at Texas A&M's Student Research Week competition where I won first place for the undergraduate poster section.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Work Experience</th>
									<td>I began my work experience when I was 15 at a greek food restaurant and then at a burger shop. When I was a freshman in college I tutored Calculus III for the TAMU MATH department, and spent the next few semesters working as a grader for Aerothermodynamics.
I spent my 7th semester of college interning for SpaceX in Boca Chica, TX. At SpaceX I wrote software for first iteration pipe system design in python using the Fanno model. I designed and built several pipe and tube systems for orbital GSE systems, and created
several python tools utilizing SpaceX's Stage0 API to monitor and project pressure system state changes based on live instrumentation data. I currently work at Los Alamos National Laboratory where I continue to use python and labview to create data aquisition and controls software alongside hardware implementations.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Skills and Proficiencies</th>
									<td>Python, LabVIEW, HTML, CSS, SolidWorks, Siemens NX, LaTeX, Office, Soldering, Wiring, Teaching, Learning, Presenting</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<th>Interests and Hobbies</th>
									<td>I spend most of my time learning new technical subjects or listening to/playing music. My areas of interest are modern physics, controls theory, machine learning, and mathematics. The genres I enjoy the most are vocal jazz, swing, neo soul, and hip hop. That being said I enjoy most music and have compiled a page with some of my reccomendations.</td>
