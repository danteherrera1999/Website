I graduated from Texas A&M Universtiy with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Astrophysics.

I started research in junior year of highschool where I studied the synthesis of YBCO high temperature superconductors under Dr.Bing Lv. culminating in a presentation in from of undergrad studends and faculty.
At TAMU I studied the characterisation and modeling of hybrid rocket engines and their combustion mechanism. I gave a presentation at Texas A&M's Student Research Week competition where I won first place for the undergraduate poster section.

I began my work experience when I was 15 at a greek food restaurant and then at a burger shop. When I was a freshman in college I tutored Calculus III for the TAMU MATH department. For the next few semesters I worked as a grader for aerothermodynamics.
I spent my 7th semester of college interning for SpaceX in Boca Chica, TX. At SpaceX I wrote software for first iteration pipe system design in python using the Fanno model. I designed and built several pipe and tube systems for orbital GSE systems, and created
several python tools utilizing SpaceX's Stage0 API to monitor and predict pressure system state changes based on live instrumentation data. I currently work at Los Alamos National Laboratory where I continue to use python and labview to create data aquisition and controls software alongside hardware implementations.

I spend most of my time learning new technical subjects or listening to/playing music. My areas of interest are modern physics, controls theory, machine learning, linear algebra. The genres I enjoy the most are vocal jazz, neo soul, and hip hop. That being said I enjoy most music and have compiled a page with some of my reccomendations.
